.. index:: Ada 2022 implementation status

.. index:: -gnat22 option (gcc)

.. index:: pragma Ada_2022

.. index:: configuration pragma Ada_2022

.. index:: Ada_2022 configuration pragma

This chapter contains a complete list of Ada 2022 features that have been
implemented. Generally, these features are only available if the *-gnat22* (Ada 2022 features enabled) option is set, or if the configuration pragma ``Ada_2022`` is used.

However, new pragmas, attributes, and restrictions are unconditionally available, since the Ada standard allows the addition of new pragmas, attributes, and restrictions (there are exceptions, which are
documented in the individual descriptions), and also certain packages
were made available in earlier versions of Ada.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses on the description line.
This date shows the implementation date of the feature. Any wavefront
subsequent to this date will contain the indicated feature, as will any
subsequent releases. A date of 0000-00-00 means that GNAT has always
implemented the feature, or implemented it as soon as it appeared as a
binding interpretation.

Each feature corresponds to an Ada Issue ('AI') approved by the Ada
standardization group (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG9) for inclusion in Ada 2022.

The section "RM references" lists all modified paragraphs in the Ada 2012 reference manual. The details of each modification as well as a complete description of the AIs may be found in
http://www.ada-auth.org/AI12-SUMMARY.HTML.

.. index:: AI12-0001 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0001 Independence and Representation clauses for atomic objects (2019-11-27)*

  The compiler accepts packing clauses in all cases, even if they have effectively no influence on the layout. Types, where packing is essentially infeasible are, for instance atomic, aliased and by-reference types.

.. index:: AI12-0004 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0004 Normalization and allowed characters for identifiers (2020-06-11)*

  This AI clarifies that Ada identifiers containing characters which are not
  allowed in Normalization Form KC are illegal.

.. index:: AI12-0020 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0020 'Image for all types (2020-03-30)*

  Put_Image prints out a human-readable representation of an object. The
  functionality in Ada2022 RM is fully implemented except the support for
  types in the ``Remote_Types`` packages.

.. index:: AI12-0022 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0022 Raise_Expressions (2013-01-27)*

  This feature allows you to write "raise NAME [with STRING]" in an
  expression to rise given exception. It is particularly useful in the case of
  assertions such as preconditions allowing to specify which exception a
  precondition raises if it fails.

.. index:: AI12-0027 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0027 Access values should never designate unaliased components (2020-06-15)*

  AI12-0027 adds a requirement for a value conversion that converts from an array of unaliased components to an array of aliased components to make a copy. It defines such conversions to have a local accessibility, effectively preventing the possibility of unsafe accesses to unaliased components.

  RM references: 4.06 (24.17/3) 4.06 (24.21/2) 4.06 (58) 6.02 (10/3) 3.10.02 (10/3)

.. index:: AI12-0028 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0028 Import of variadic C functions (2020-03-03)*

  Ada programs can now properly call variadic C functions by means of the
  conventions C_Variadic_<n>, for small integer values <n>.

  RM references: B.03 (1/3) B.03 (60.15/3) B.03 (75)

.. index:: AI12-0030 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0030 Formal derived types and stream attribute availability (2020-08-21)*

  Corner cases involving streaming operations for formal derived limited types
  that are now defined to raise Program_Error. Before, behavior in these cases
  was undefined. Stream attribute availability is more precisely computed in cases where a derived type declaration occurs ahead of a streaming attribute specification for the parent type.

  RM references: 12.05.01 (21/3) 13.13.02 (49/2)

.. index:: AI12-0031 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0031 All_Calls_Remote and indirect calls (0000-00-00)*

  Remote indirect calls (i.e., calls through a remote access-to-subprogram type)
  behave the same as remote direct calls.

  RM references: E.02.03 (19/3)

.. index:: AI12-0032 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0032 Questions on 'Old (2020-04-24)*

  AI12-0032 resolves several issues related to the 'Old attribute. The GNAT
  compiler already implemented what the AI requires in most of those cases, but two having to do with static and dynamic checking of the accessibility level of the constant object implicitly declared for an 'Old attribute reference were not yet implemented. Accessibility checking for these constants is now implemented as defined in the AI.

  RM references: 4.01.03 (9/3) 6.01.01 (22/3) 6.01.01 (26/3) 6.01.01 (35/3)

.. index:: AI12-0033 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0033 Sets of CPUs when defining dispatching domains (0000-00-00)*

  The set of CPUs associated with a dispatching domain is no longer required
  to be a contiguous range of CPU values.

  RM references: D.16.01 (7/3) D.16.01 (9/3) D.16.01 (20/3) D.16.01 (23/3)
  D.16.01 (24/3) D.16.01 (26/3)

.. index:: AI12-0035 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0035 Accessibility checks for indefinite elements of containers (0000-00-00)*

  If the element type for an instance of one of the indefinite container generics has an access discriminant, then accessibility checks (at run-time) prevent inserting a value into a container object if the value's discriminant designates an object that is too short-lived (that is, if the designated object has an accessibility level that is deeper than that of the instance). Without this check, dangling references would be possible. GNAT handled this correctly already before this AI was issued.

.. index:: AI12-0036 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0036 The actual for an untagged formal derived type cannot be tagged (2019-10-21)*

  AI12-0036 is a binding interpretation that adds the following legality rule:
  The actual type for a formal derived type shall be tagged if and only if the
  formal derived type is a private extension. The check is implemented for all Ada dialects, not just Ada 2022.

  RM references: 12.05.01 (5.1/3)

.. index:: AI12-0037 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0037 New types in Ada.Locales can't be converted to/from strings (2016-09-10)*

  The type definitions for Language_Code and Country_Code are now using dynamic
  predicates.

  RM references: A.19 (4/3)

.. index:: AI12-0039 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0039 Ambiguity in syntax for membership expression removed (0000-00-00)*

  An ambiguity in the syntax for membership expressions was resolved. For example, "A in B and C" can be parsed in only one way because of this AI.

.. index:: AI12-0040 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0040 Resolving the selecting_expression of a case_expression (0000-00-00)*

  The definition of "complete context" is corrected so that selectors of case expressions
  and of case statements are treated uniformly.

  RM references: 8.06 (9)

.. index:: AI12-0041 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0041 Type_Invariant'Class for interface types (2016-12-12)*

  Subprogram calls within class-wide type invariant expressions get resolved
  as primitive operations instead of being dynamically dispatched.

  RM references: 7.03.02 (1/3) 7.03.02 (3/3)

.. index:: AI12-0042 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0042 Type invariant checking rules (2020-06-05)*

  AI12-0042 adds rules for type invariants.
  Specifically, when inheriting a private dispatching operation when the ancestor operation is visible at the point of the type extension, the operation must be abstract or else overridden. In addition, for a class-wide view conversion from an object of a specific type T to which a type invariant applies, an invariant check is performed when the conversion is within the immediate scope of T.

  7.03.02 (20/3)

.. index:: AI12-0043 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0043 Details of the storage pool used when Storage_Size is specified (0000-00-00)*

  Clarify that a Storage_Size specification for an access type specifies both an upper bound and a lower bound (not just a lower bound) of the amount of storage allowed for allocated objects.

  RM references: 13.11 (18)

.. index:: AI12-0044 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0044 Calling visible functions from type invariant expressions (2020-05-11)*

  AI05-0289-1 extends invariant checking to `in` parameters. However, this makes
  it impossible to call a public function of the type from an invariant
  expression, as that public function will attempt to check the invariant,
  resulting in an infinite recursion.

  This AI specifies, that type-invariant checking is performed on parameters
  of mode `in` upon return from procedure calls, but not of `in`-mode
  parameters in functions.

  RM references: 7.03.02 (19/3)

.. index:: AI12-0045 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0045 Pre- and Postconditions are allowed on generic subprograms (2015-03-17)*

  The SPARK toolset now supports contracts on generic subprograms, packages and
  their respective bodies.

  RM references: 6.01.01 (1/3)

.. index:: AI12-0046 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0046 Enforcing legality for anonymous access components in record aggregates (0000-00-00)*

  For a record aggregate of the form (X | Y => ....), any relevant legality rules are checked for both for X and Y.

  For example,

  .. code::

      X : aliased constant String := ... ;
      type R is record
        F1 : access constant String;
        F2 : access String;
      end record;
      Obj : R := (F1 | F2 => X'Access); -- ok for F1, but illegal for F2

  RM references: 4.03.01 (16/3)

.. index:: AI12-0047 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0047 Generalized iterators and discriminant-dependent components (0000-00-00)*

  Iterating over the elements of an array is subject to the same legality checks as renaming the array. For example, if an assignment to an enclosing discriminated object could cause an array object to cease to exist then we don't allow renaming the array. So it is similarly not allowed to iterate over the elements of such an array.

  RM references: 5.05.02 (6/3)

.. index:: AI12-0048 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0048 Default behavior of tasks on a multiprocessor with a specified dispatching policy (0000-00-00)*

  Clarify that if the user does not impose requirements about what CPUs a given task might execute on, then the implementation does not get to impose such requirements. This avoids potential problems with priority inversion.

  RM references: D.16.01 (30/3)

.. index:: AI12-0049 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0049 Invariants need to be checked on the initialization of deferred constants (0000-00-00)*

  Invariant checking for deferred constants (and subcomponents thereof) is performed. Corrects a clear oversight in the previous RM wording.

  RM references: 7.03.02 (10/3)

.. index:: AI12-0050 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0050 Conformance of quantified expressions (2016-07-22)*

  Compiler rejects a subprogram body when an expression for a boolean formal
  parameter includes a quantified expression, and the subprogram declaration
  contains a textual copy of the same.

  RM references: 6.03.01 (20) 6.03.01 (21)

.. index:: AI12-0051 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0051 The Priority aspect can be specified when Attach_Handler is specified (0000-00-00)*

  Previous RM wording had two contradictory rules for determining (in some cases) the priority of a protected subprogram that is attached to an interrupt. The AI clarifies which one of the rules takes precedence.

  RM references: D.03 (10/3)

.. index:: AI12-0052 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0052 Implicit objects are considered overlapping (0000-00-00)*

  Clarify that the rules about unsynchronized concurrent access apply as one would expect in the case of predefined routines that access Text_IO's default input and default output files. There was no compiler changes needed to implement this.

  RM references: A (3/2) A.10.03 (21)

.. index:: AI12-0054-2 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0054-2 Aspect Predicate_Failure (0000-00-00)*

  New aspect Predicate_Failure is defined.  A solution for the problem that a predicate like

  ..  code::

    subtype Open_File is File with Dynamic_Predicate =\> Is_Open (Open_File) or else (raise File_Not_Open);

  does the wrong thing in the case of a membership test.

  RM references: 3.02.04 (14/3) 3.02.04 (31/3) 3.02.04 (35/3)

.. index:: AI12-0055 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0055 All properties of a usage profile are defined by pragmas (2020-06-09)*

  AI12-0055 allows the use of the No_Dynamic_CPU_Assignment restriction in pragmas Restrictions and Restrictions_Warnings.

  RM references: D.07 (10/3) D.13 (6/3) D.13 (8/3) D.13 (10/3)

.. index:: AI12-0059 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0059 Object_Size attribute (2019-12-02)*

  AI12-0059 brings GNAT-defined attribute Object_Size to Ada standard
  and clarifies its semantics. Given that the attribute already existed in
  GNAT compiler, the feature is supported for all language versions.

.. index:: AI12-0061 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0061 Iterated component associations in array aggregates (2016-09-01)*

  Ada issue AI12-061 introduces a new construct in array aggregates allowing
  component associations to be parameterized by a loop variable, for example:

  .. code::

    Array (1 .. 10) of Integer :=
      (for I in 1 .. 10 => I ** 2);
    type Matrix is
    array
      (Positive range <>, Positive range <>) of Float;
    G : constant Matrix
    :=
      (for I in 1 .. 4 =>
          (for J in 1 .. 4 =>
              (if I=J then
    1.0 else 0.0))); -- Identity matrix

  The expression in such an association can also be a function that returns a
  limited type, and the range can be specified by the 'others' choice.

.. index:: AI12-0062 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0062 Raise exception with failing string function (0000-00-00)*

  Clarify that if raising exception E1 is accompanied with a String-valued
  expression whose evaluation raises exception E2, then E2 is what gets propagated.

  RM references: 11.03 (4/2)

.. index:: AI12-0065 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0065 Descendants of incomplete views (0000-00-00)*

  This AI is a clarification of potentially confusing wording.  GNAT correctly handles the example given in AARM 7.3.1(5.b-5.d), which illustrates the topic of this AI.

  RM references: 7.03.01 (5.2/3)

.. index:: AI12-0067 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0067 Accessibility level of explicitly aliased parameters of procedures and entries (0000-00-00)*

  The AI fixes a case where the intent was fairly obvious but the RM wording failed to mention a case (with the result that the accessibility level of an explicitly aliased parameter of a procedure or entry was undefined even though the intent was clear).

  RM references: 3.10.02 (7/3)

.. index:: AI12-0068 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0068 Predicates and the current instance of a subtype (2020-05-06)*

  AI12-0068 is a binding interpretation that defines the current instance name in a type or subtype aspect to be a value rather than an object. This affects
  attributes whose prefix is a current instance in predicates, type invariants, and ``Default_Initial_Condition`` aspects. In particular, in the case of the ``Constrained`` attribute the value will always be True, and formerly legal attributes that require an object as their prefix (such as ``Size``, ``Access``, ``Address``, etc.) are illegal when applied to a current instance in type and subtype aspects.

  RM references: 8.06 (17/3)

.. index:: AI12-0069 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0069 Inconsistency in Tree container definition (0000-00-00)*

  The description of how iteration over a Tree container's elements was contradictory in some cases regarding whether a cursor designating the Root node is included in the iteration. This contradiction was resolved. In the "!ACATS Test" section of the AI, it says that if an implementation were to get this wrong then almost any attempt to iterate over any tree would fail at runtime.

  RM references: A.18.10 (153/3) A.18.10 (155/3) A.18.10 (157/3) A.18.10 (159/3)

.. index:: AI12-0070 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0070 9.3(2) does not work for anonymous access types (0000-00-00)*

  The RM contained some old wording about the master of an allocated object that only made sense for named access types. The AI clarifies the wording to clearly state the scope of validity and ensures that the paragraph does not contradict 3.10.2's rules for anonymous access  types.

  RM references: 3.10.02 (13.1/3) 9.03 (2)

.. index:: AI12-0071 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0071 Order of evaluation when multiple predicates apply (2015-08-10)*

  AI12-0071 specifies the semantics of multiple/inherited predicates on a
  single subtype.

  Ada 2022 adds (as a binding interpretation) a ``No_Dependence =>
  Ada.Synchronous_Barriers`` restriction to the Ravenscar profile.

  RM references: D.13 (6/3)

.. index:: AI12-0074 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0074 View conversions and out parameters passed by copy (2020-03-26)*

  This Ada 2022 AI makes illegal some cases of out parameters whose type has a
  ``Default_Value`` aspect.

.. index:: AI12-0075 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0075 Static expression functions (2020-04-13)*

  Ada 2022 defines a new aspect ``Static`` that can be specified on expression
  functions. Such an expression function can be called in contexts requiring static expressions when the actual parameters are all static, allowing for greater abstraction in complex static expressions.

.. index:: AI12-0076 (Ada 2022 feature)

* *AI12-0076 Variable state in pure packages (0000-00-00)*

  Defines an obscure constant-modifying construct to be erroneous. The issue is that the current instance of a type is a variable object, so the following is legal:

  .. code::

* *AI12-0101 Incompatibility of hidden untagged record equality (2019-10-31)*

  AI12-0101 is a binding interpretation that removes a legality rule that
  prohibited the declaration of a primitive equality function for a private type in the private part of its enclosing package (either before or after the completion of the type) when the type is completed as an untagged record type. Such declarations are now accepted in Ada 2012 and later Ada versions.

  As a consequence of this work, some cases where the implementation of AI05-0123 was incomplete were corrected.
  More specifically, if a user-defined equality operator is present for an untagged record type in an Ada 2012 program, that user-defined equality operator will be (correctly) executed in some difficult-to-characterize cases where the predefined component-by-component comparison was previously being (incorrectly) executed. This can arise, for example, in the case of the predefined equality operation for an enclosing composite type that has a component of the user-defined primitive equality op's operand type.
  This correction means that the impact of this change is not limited solely to code that was previously rejected at compile time.

  if a nonoverridable aspect is explicitly specified for a type that also inherits that aspect from another type (an ancestor or a progenitor), then the explicit aspect specification shall be confirming. The second says that if a type inherits a nonoverridable aspect from two different sources (this can only occur if at least one of the two is an interface type), then the two sources shall agree with respect to the given aspect. This AI is a binding interpretation, so these checks are performed even for earlier Ada versions. Because of compatibility concerns, an escape mechanism for suppressing these legality checks is provided: these new checks always pass if the ``-gnatd.M`` switch (relaxed RM semantics) is specified.

  Compiler support is added for three new aspects (``Integer_Literal``, ``Real_Literal``, and ``String_Literal``) as described in AI12-0249 (for ``Integer_Literal`` and ``Real_Literal``), AI12-0295 (for  ``String_Literal``), and in two follow-up AIs (AI12-0325 and AI12-0342). For pre-Ada 2022 versions of Ada, these are treated as implementation-defined
  aspects. Some implementation work remains, particularly in the interactions between these aspects and tagged types.

* *AI12-0258 Containers and controlled element types (0000-00-00)*

  Most predefined containers are allowed to defer finalization of container elements until the finalization of the container. This allows implementation flexibility  but  causes problems in some cases. AI12-0258 tightens up the rules for the indefinite containers to say that finalization happens earlier - if a client needs the tighter finalization guarantees, then it can use the indefinite containers (even if the element subtype in question is definite). Other solutions involving the holder generic are also possible.

  GNAT implements these tighter element finalization requirements for instances of the indefinite container generics.

  For Ada 2022, AI12-0280-2 relaxes Ada's restrictions on 'Old attribute
  references whose attribute prefix does not statically name an entity. Previously, it was required that such an attribute reference must be unconditionally evaluated when the postcondition is evaluated; with the new rule, conditional evaluation is permitted if the relevant conditions can be evaluated upon entry to the subprogram with the same results as evaluation at the time of the postcondition's evaluation. In this case, the 'Old attribute prefix is evaluated conditionally (more specifically, the prefix is evaluated only if the result of that evaluation is going to be referenced later when the
  postcondition is evaluated).

The type of the current instance is defined to be like a formal derived type, so for a derived type that inherits the aspect, a call passing the current instance to a primitive means that the call will resolve to invoke the corresponding primitive of the descendant type. This also now permits calls to abstract primitives to occur within the aspect expression of an abstract type.

Types declared within a generic package specification are permitted to specify the expression of a ``Prelaborable_Initialization`` aspect by including one or more references to the attribute applied to a formal private or formal derived type conjoined by ``and`` operators. This permits the full type of a private type with such an aspect expression to have components of the named formal types, and such a type will have preelaborable initialization in an instance when the
